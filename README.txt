 MOS GPU- Modern Open Source Graphical Processing Unit.
 
 Currently work in really early stage of pogress. Tune in occasionally for updates.
 
 Aims and goals: 
 - PCIe Gen4 compatible
 - GDDR6 compatible
 - Modern, fast and fully functional GPU
 - Compatible with latest DirectX and Vulkan
 - Fully open source, up to the last transistor
 - Fully synthetizable on silicon
 
 
 F.A.Q.
 ...Why?
 Well, it stared a bit as a rant on nVidia and AMD during 2018. Afterwards, I realized that, since we now have 
 open source CPU architecture, open source GPU and GPU architecture would be in order. 
 
 ...Can I contribute?
 If you have some knowledge about GPU architecture and computers, and you are fully fluent in Verilog, feel free
 to improve it. 
 
 ...Can I donate?
 Currently, no. 
 
 TODO: 
 - Proposed microarchitecture
 - Start a Wiki
 - PCIe x16 gen4 interface
 - GDDR6 controller
